# Soccer Analyst — an Agent Skill

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)
![Format: Agent Skill](https://img.shields.io/badge/format-SKILL.md-black.svg)

A football (soccer) analysis skill for Claude and other agents that read the
[Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) `SKILL.md` format.

It makes the model read matches, clubs and transfers the way a good co-commentator would
if he had also read the economics: **verdict first, one named mechanism, no hedging cloud** —
and an explicit refusal to invent a tactical story for a result that was really a red card,
a deflection, or one team simply being better.

---

## What it does

| Capability | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Match reading** | *One* specific decision that explains the result — a pressing trigger, a full-back's starting position, a substitution's timing — in plain language, with a mandatory honesty check that allows "nothing tactical happened here." |
| **Club analysis** | Vague fan questions ("what's going on at United?") get reframed into the actual decision underneath, then answered with a position and the one thing that would change it. |
| **Financial–tactical synthesis** | Wage-bill reasoning brought in *only* when it bears on the decision, with strict scale discipline (money explains ~5–10% of one match, ~90% of a decade), plus an explicit flag when a "tactics problem" is really a budget problem. |
| **Fan-register honesty** | Blunt questions get blunt answers first. Verdict, then reasoning, then jargon — and only if the jargon earns its place. |

```

`SKILL.md` is deliberately short. The five `reference-*.md` files are loaded **on demand** —
the routing table at the top of `SKILL.md` tells the agent which one to open for which job,
so a transfer question never drags in the tactical history and vice versa.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Copy the skill folder into either location:

```bash
# personal — available in every project
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r soccer-analyst ~/.claude/skills/

# or project-scoped — checked into the repo you're working in
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r soccer-analyst .claude/skills/
```

Start a new session. The skill is picked up automatically when a request matches its
description, and is also available as `/soccer-analyst`.

### Claude.ai and the Claude API

Zip the `soccer-analyst/` folder (the zip must contain `SKILL.md` at the top level of that
folder) and upload it as a custom skill. Current instructions:
[claude.ai skills](https://support.claude.com) · [Skills on the API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

### Other agents

The format is the open Agent Skills standard, so the same folder works anywhere `SKILL.md`
files are supported — drop it in that tool's skills directory.

## Usage

Ask normally; the skill triggers on football questions.

```
"Arsenal 1–3 at home. What actually went wrong?"
"Should Everton sack the manager in January?"
"Is he finished?"
"They just paid £55m for a 29-year-old striker who had a great World Cup. Verdict?"
```

Expect answers shaped like this:

> **The sending-off is the story.** Everything after the 34th minute is consequence, not
> tactics. Before it, the game was even — and I wouldn't read a system into forty minutes.

> **Sack him, but not until the replacement is signed** — and the replacement is the real
> problem. On that wage bill they should be finishing eighth, and they're eleventh; that
> residual is small enough that a new manager buys you almost nothing except another
> rebuild squad the club will pay for twice.

The skill is explicitly instructed to fetch current data (results, tables, squads, fees)
rather than recite it from memory. Its source books end between 2015 and 2022 — they supply
frameworks and precedents, not today's team sheet.

## Design notes

A few decisions worth knowing if you want to fork it:

- **One mechanism per claim.** "They were poor" is banned. Every assertion has to name the
  space, the trigger, the player, or the number that produces it.
- **The honesty check is load-bearing.** Inventing a tactical cause for a random result is
  the stated worst failure mode, so "nothing tactical" is an approved answer.
- **Money is opt-in.** Forcing wage bills into a match post-mortem is treated as exactly as
  bad as ignoring them in a transfer question.
- **No great-man history.** Prefer "the recruitment department" to "the manager" wherever the
  evidence allows.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Reference files carry the detail; `SKILL.md` carries the routing.

## Sources

The skill's frameworks are distilled from five books. The reference files are original
summaries and analytical notes — mental models, decision rules, terminology — not
reproductions of the texts.

| Book | Author(s) | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| *Inverting the Pyramid* | Jonathan Wilson | Why a shape exists, what it fears, what beats it; pressing fundamentals |
| *The Mixer* | Michael Cox | Premier League era context and precedents |
| *Zonal Marking* | Michael Cox | Pressing triggers, positional play, national styles |
| *Money and Soccer* | Stefan Szymanski | Wage–performance, what a club's finances permit |
| *Soccernomics* | Simon Kuper & Stefan Szymanski | Transfer inefficiencies, manager effects, amortization |

If you want the arguments in full, buy the books. They are better than any summary of them.

## Scope and limitations

These five books are the foundation, not the boundary of the sport. Coverage is thin on
women's club football, most non-European leagues, and post-2022 developments — the skill is
instructed to say so rather than extrapolate with false confidence.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Useful contributions:

- tightening a decision rule that produces mushy answers in practice
- adding a reference file for a source that fills a named gap above
- example prompts with the answers the skill actually gave, good or bad

Please keep reference files in the existing structure (Mental Model → Frameworks → Worked
Example → Decision Rules → Key Takeaways) and keep them as original summary, not excerpt.
